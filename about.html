            <h3>
                Charccuties is the leader in charcuterie innovation and design. Founded in 1954,
                the idea of cold cuts and cheeses on a wooden platter came about from the
                necessity of creating a presentable meal with various scraps left around. Sam
                Reskala Sr. III pioneered this idea and led the modernization of what
                charcuterie is all about today. Here at Charccuties not only do we teach you the
                elements necessary to bring to life your charcuterie crreations but also the
                style to wow everyone at the dinner table.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                We have several plans available that range in prices: Basic, Advanced, and
                Premium. The Basic plan at $9.99/month is our most basic subscription package
                that includes one Charccuties special board – which is a one time item upon
                registration – along with a selection of 5 cold cuts, 3 cheeses, 2 spreads, and
                a booklet on different ideas to layout the board (these all come monthly).
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The Advanced package costing $14.99 includes everything the Basic plan does plus
                an extra selection of 3 more cold cuts, 4 extra cheeses, double the spreads, as
                well as video tutorials and a communication line with our Charcuterie Chefs.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The Premium plan which costs $29.99/month has everything the Advanced package
                does with a WHOLE LOT MORE! This plan gets you 20 cold cuts, 15 cheeses, 8
                spreads, baby pickles, a jar of olives, and one-on-one home instruction on
                crafting the perfect board from our licensed Charccutie Chefs, it’s the perfect
